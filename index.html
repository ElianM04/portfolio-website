        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Elian Maycock a spring 22 graduate of Fisk university with a degree in Data science. 
            I was born and raised Nassau Bahamas where I attended elementary and high school. 
            in my last year of high school, I received a full tuition academic scholarship as well as government grant ($10,000) to attend Fisk university.
            Here I would study computer/data science for four years and earn My BA in Data science. 
            during my time at Fisk my courses as well as the student projects that I was required to complete have given me experiences in multiple different areas in the tech field such as proficiency in multiple coding languages (python, java, html, CSS, pandas, R, etc..), application development software's such as android studio and AWS (amazon Web Services), as well as communication/leadership skills which allowed me to effectively work with others on large scale projects. 
            unfortunately, due to the covid 19 pandemic and my status as an international student I have run into many challenges seeking employment and summer internships however AI have not let these challenges stop me from pursuing my goals. 
            I am currently in the process of obtaining as certification in AWS and plan on pursuing others in the different coding languages that I am familiar with to show proof of my skillset. 
            last but not least the reason I am pursuing a career in the tech industry is because of the infinite number of possibilities that lye here. the world is becoming more technology based every day, all of the major companies/business around the world require some level of technological expertise to keep their companies relevant, whether that be google, Microsoft, the NBA, the NFL, etc. as someone with multiple different passions and ideas the tech industry allows me fully explore these passions whether that be building machine learning models to make sense of the data used in the NBA or building a forex trading robot to make passive income while I sleep.
            my desire to develop and learn new ways to help the world evolve through software and technology is never ending and I look forward to working with anyone who values my mindset/skillset.
